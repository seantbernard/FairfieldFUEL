* The Entrepreneurship Center’s web page has a lot of content, not all of it is necessary pertinent to starting a business. They have numerous containers in a three column format, with a navigation bar at the very top of the page helping you locate different services. The first paragraph includes a thorough description of what services the Entrepreneurship Center provides. A good aspect their website includes is the names of sponsors of the program and supports of specific business teams and their plans. The only issue with this site is its length, the web page continues to scroll listing names of past supports. They definitely could rearrange the site to avoid this issue of length by condensing their information.
